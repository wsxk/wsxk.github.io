> 2. insert mode ：  esc i #对文件插入内容
> 3. replace mode：  esc R #取代光标所指向的内容
> 4. visual mode：   esc v #复制黏贴用
> 5. command-line    esc : #文件保存，退出等操作。

2. To start Vim from the shell prompt type:  vim FILENAME <ENTER>

```

# lesson 2 delete and undo <br>
```txt
1. To delete from the cursor up to the next word type:    dw
2. To delete from the cursor to the end of a line type:    d$
3. To delete a whole line type:    dd

4. To repeat a motion prepend it with a number:   2w
5. The format for a change command is:
            operator   [number]   motion
    where:
    operator - is what to do, such as  d  for delete
    [number] - is an optional count to repeat the motion
    motion   - moves over the text to operate on, such as  w (word),
                $ (to the end of line), etc.

6. To move to the start of the line use a zero:  0

7. To undo previous actions, type:           u  (lowercase u)
    To undo all the changes on a line, type:  U  (capital U)
    To undo the undo's, type:                 CTRL-R
```
# lesson 3 p,replace,ce<br>
```txt

     deleted text AFTER the cursor (if a line was deleted it will go on the
     line below the cursor).

  2. To replace the character under the cursor, type   r   and then the
     character you want to have there.

  3. The change operator allows you to change from the cursor to where the
     motion takes you.  eg. Type  ce  to change from the cursor to the end of
     the word,  c$  to change to the end of a line.

  4. The format for change is:
